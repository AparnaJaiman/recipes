Ingredients:
 - 5-6 Idlis
 - 20-25 Curry Leaves
 - 4-5 Dried Red Chillies
 - 3-4 Cloves of Garlic
 - 1 Teaspoon Cumin Seeds (Jeera)
 - 1 Teaspoon Black Peppercorns (Sabut Kali Mirch)
 - 1 Teaspoon Mustard Seeds
 - 1 Teaspoon Urad Dal (Split & Skinned Black Gram Lentils)
 - 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
 - 1/2 Teaspoon Sambar Masala
 - 1/2 Teaspoon Amchur (Dry Mango Powder)
 - 1 Tablespoon Oil

Directions:
 1. Combine Dried Red Chillies, Curry Leaves, Cumin Seeds, Garlic Cloves and Black Peppercorn in a blender and grind it coarsely.

 2. Cut the Idlis into bite sized pieces. Leftover Idli works best since it's less crumbly. If you are using fresh made Idlis, then you can refrigerate them for 30 mins before using.

 3. Heat 1 Tablespoon oil in a pan and fry the idlis till they are crispy and light brown in color. Traditionally the Idlis are deep fried, but I have just shallow fried for a healthier version. You can also bake the Idlis instead. Set the fried Idlis aside.

 4. In the same pan, add some Black Mustard Seeds (Rai) and Urad Dal.

 5. Now add the spice mixture prepared earlier and fry for a few seconds.

 6. Then add the Fried Idlis to the pan. Now add Salt, Sambar Masala and Amchur. Toss the Idlis in the masala mixture to coat them evenly.
